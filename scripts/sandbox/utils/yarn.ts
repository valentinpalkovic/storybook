 * and NO `package.json`.

 * any `yarn` command run in `cwd` — a `yarn.lock` with no `package.json` is a
 * broken project — or (b) treat `before-storybook` as a stray nested package and
 * reject it. A bare config-only directory sidesteps both: `before-storybook`,
 * which has its own `package.json`, is correctly resolved as the project root.
 *
 * The scratch `yarn.lock` exists only while `yarn set version` runs, then is
 * removed.
