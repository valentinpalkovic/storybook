# Storybook CSF Tools

An experimental library to read, analyze, transform, and write CSF programmatically.

- Read - Parse a CSF file with Babel
- Analyze - Extract its metadata & stories based on the Babel AST
- Transform - Edit meta, story, and annotation objects through `CsfFile.objects()`
- Write - Write the AST back to a file

It can parse MDX into CSF.

## Transforming stories

`CsfFile.objects()` returns one `CsfObject` editor per mutable object it can prove safe to edit: the meta, each story export, and each CSF2 `Story.parameters` / `Story.story` annotation assignment.
`{ meta, stories, annotations }` narrows what is discovered; meta and stories are included by default, annotations only when listed.

Each editor reads and writes static property paths with `get`, `set`, `transform`, `remove`, `rename`, and `move`.
Nodes reused by `transform` keep their original source, so relocating a value prints it as written instead of pretty-printing it.
Annotation editors take the same paths as their story counterparts, so `['parameters', 'a11y']` addresses `Story.parameters.a11y` and an inline `parameters.a11y` alike.

Discovery and mutation are conservative: an object or a path whose shape cannot be proven is left untouched, and the reason is reported on `CsfFile.mutationDiagnostics` as a `CsfMutationDiagnostic`.
Unproven shapes include story or meta bindings that are reassigned or aliased, a CSF factory configuration that is not an object literal owned by that single factory call, dynamically computed annotation names, and target paths shadowed by a spread, a duplicate field, or a computed key.

`CsfFile.changed` is true once any mutation has been applied, which is the signal for whether the file needs to be written back.
